## CodeGenBot - Android Code Converter and Optimizer 🤖💻
- CodeGenBot is a powerful tool designed for Android developers to convert code between Java, Kotlin, and XML layouts, as well as generate Jetpack Compose code snippets. Additionally, it offers code optimization suggestions using machine learning models, making the development process more efficient.

# 📄 Project Overview
- This project leverages code conversion tools and machine learning to optimize Android development workflows. It converts Java to Kotlin (and vice versa), parses Android XML layouts, and generates Jetpack Compose code. Code optimization is performed using models like CodeBERT to suggest performance and style improvements.

# Key Features 🌟
- 🔄 Java to Kotlin and Kotlin to Java conversion
- 🛠️ Android XML layout generator
- ✍️ Jetpack Compose code generator from XML layouts
- ⚡ Code optimization using machine learning models
- 🏗️ Project Structure

# The project includes several major components:
- Code Conversion: Converts Android code between Java and Kotlin using simple rule-based approaches.
- XML Layout Parsing: Parses Android XML layouts and generates equivalent Jetpack Compose code.
- Machine Learning Optimization: Utilizes transformer models to analyze and optimize code for performance and readability.
- GitHub Integration: Clones GitHub repositories for code analysis and refactoring.

# 🚀 How to Run the Project
#Prerequisites 🛠️
Ensure that you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

# pip install tensorflow torch transformers kotlin-poet gitpython beautifulsoup4
- Steps to Run ⚙️
- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries using the above command.
- Open and run the Jupyter notebook or run the Python script to use CodeGenBot.

# Example Usage 📋
- Convert Java to Kotlin:
java_code = '''
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
'''
kotlin_code = java_to_kotlin(java_code)
print(kotlin_code)

- Convert Kotlin to Java:
kotlin_code = '''
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
'''
java_code = kotlin_to_java(kotlin_code)
print(java_code)

# 🔄 Example Workflow
- Code Conversion:
- Convert Android Java code to Kotlin:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

- To Kotlin:

class Main {
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        println("Hello, World!")
    }
}

# Code Optimization:
- Using transformer models like CodeBERT, the project analyzes code to provide optimization suggestions. For example:

from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the code optimization pipeline
optimizer = pipeline('text-generation', model='microsoft/CodeBERTa')

# Example code optimization
code_to_optimize = '''
fun calculateSum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
'''

optimized_code = optimizer(code_to_optimize)
print(optimized_code)

# 📊 Project Report
# Objectives 🎯
- The goal of CodeGenBot is to streamline the Android development process by:

- Facilitating fast code conversion between Java and Kotlin.
- Generating Jetpack Compose code from XML layouts for modern Android development.
- Providing machine learning-powered code optimizations to improve code quality.

#Methodology 🛠️
- Code Conversion: Simple rule-based converters transform Java to Kotlin and vice versa.
- Layout Parsing: XML layouts are parsed and transformed into Jetpack Compose code using string manipulation and parsing libraries.
- Optimization: Machine learning models analyze code for potential improvements and best practices.

# Future Enhancements 🔮
- Add support for more complex code conversion logic (e.g., handling libraries and frameworks).
- Enhance the machine learning model to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in code.
- Add user authentication and repository management for large-scale code analysis.
